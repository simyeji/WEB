  <p>JavaScript
    often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted
    scripting language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
    JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based
    object-orientation, and first-class functions.
   Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies
   of the World Wide Web.[9] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and
   is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it,[10]
   and major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
